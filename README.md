# CS-370-Current-and-Emerging-Trends-in-Computer-Science

## Introduction
In this course we examined the latest advances in Computer Science. The current trends in Computer Science all seemingly involve the latest Artificial Intelligence trends. With the release of the latest version of ChatGPT and Bing Search respectively, there has been a verifiable craze in using these artificial intelligence platforms. 

## Brief Summary of Course
Our course looked into machine learning and developing neural networks. We worked with and created code that would interact with pre made scenarios in order to solve a problem. Our first problem involved a balancing a cartpole and teaching an artificial agent how to keep a cartpole centered. The second problem we faced in this course involved using and Artificial agent to traverse a maze and end up in the treasure zone. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientist are at the cutting edge of Science in our modern world. Our ability to use math and machines to solve problems in every field allow us to be polymaths in a sense. While we don't necessarily have to be a master in each and every field we find solutions for, we are able to use logic and mathematics to provide answers and solutions to the biggest problems facing humanity.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities that we have to the end users and organizations we work with are many. We are responsible for providing unbiased, socially responsible, helpful solutions to the problems we face. Computer Scientists have a massive impact on shaping the world around us and it is our responsibility to ensure that this impact in beneficial to the whole of humanity.
